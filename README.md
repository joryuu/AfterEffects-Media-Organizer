# After Effects Media Organizer Script

## Overview

This script was designed to help me organize media compositions in After Effects, specifically for templates like the Photography Portfolio by millionframes on Envato. If you’re using a template that has multiple media placeholders (e.g., "Media [number]" compositions), it can be difficult to keep track of which image or video appears where in the final output.

The script automatically adds a text layer to each "Media [number]" comp, displaying the composition’s name (e.g., "Media 1", "Media 2"). Additionally, it applies the CC Repetile effect to ensure the comp name is visible across the entire composition, making it easy to identify each media slot as you work.

## Features

- Adds a text layer to each "Media [number]" composition.
- Automatically sets the text to the name of the composition (e.g., "Media 5").
- Applies the CC Repetile effect, repeating the comp name across the entire composition.
- Optionally includes padding to keep the text away from the edges of the comp.

## How to Use

1. Select the folder in your After Effects project that contains all the "Media [number]" compositions.
2. Run the script in After Effects by going to File > Scripts > Run Script File....
3. The script will loop through all compositions in the folder, adding a text layer and applying the necessary effects.

## Requirements

- Adobe After Effects (tested on version 24.6.1 Build 2).
- A template or project file with compositions named in the format "Media [number]" (e.g., "Media 1", "Media 2").

## Why This Script?
When working with templates, it’s common to need your media files to appear in a specific order. This script saves you time and effort by labeling and organizing media compositions automatically, helping you avoid mistakes and confusion in large projects.
